        <h2>Dybbøl Mill</h2>
        <p>
           Dybbøl Mill is one of Denmark's most important national symbols. During the war of 1864, it became the symbol of the bravery of the Danish soldiers on the battlefield, and in the period 1864-1920 the symbol of the struggle of the Danish-minded southern Jutlanders under German rule.
            At the same time, it was a completely ordinary mill, which was run until 1990.<br> Today, the mill is a museum. On
 the ground floor of the  grain magazine,    is an exhibition 
   about the history of the mill 1744-2020. 
   Here you can learn more about the influence of the 
   two Schleswig Wars on the mill and about the family 
   who lived there at the time. On the magazine loft, 
   you will find an exhibition about Dybbøl as a symbol and about the many 
national celebrations - both Danish and German - that have taken place at Dybbøl Banke.<br>
In the mill tower, you can see the old grinders and the big spur wheel. Afterwards you 
can go out on to the gallery 
and enjoy the beautiful view of Dybbøl Banke, Sønderborg and Vemmingbund.
Upstairs, you will find a special exhibition
 dedicated to Dybbøl’s role as a national symbol, showcasing the many 
 , gatherings, and commemorative events—both
  Danish and German that have taken place at Dybbøl Banke over the centuries.<br>
  Visitors can also climb the mill tower, where 
  the old grinders and the impressive spur wheel have been preserved. 
  Stepping out onto the gallery rewards you with a panoramic view over
   Dybbøl Banke, Sønderborg, and the shoreline of 
  Vemmingbund a landscape that holds both natural beauty and deep historical significance.
