            <h2>Early Beginnings</h2>
            <p>
                The area around Sønderborg has been inhabited for thousands of years. 
                Archaeological findings show that the island of Als was home to early 
                farming communities and fishing settlements long before written history began.
                Because the region is surrounded by water, it became an easy place for people 
                to travel, trade, and build a life. Many small villages grew around the coastline,
                forming the early foundation of what would later become Sønderborg.
            </p>
            <p>
                During the Viking Age, the region played a modest but important role in trade. 
                While Sønderborg itself was not yet a town, the coastline was used for travel 
                routes between Denmark and Northern Germany.

            <h2>The Rise of Sønderborg and the Castle</h2>
            <p>
                The real history of Sønderborg begins around the 12th century when the first 
                parts of Sønderborg Castle were built. The castle was placed at a strategic 
                location between the island of Als and the mainland, making it an important 
                military and political stronghold.
            </p>
            <p>
                Over time, the castle was expanded several times. It became the home of Danish 
                kings and nobles, and it played a central role in many conflicts. One of the 
                most famous residents was King Christian II, who was imprisoned in the castle 
                for 17 years after losing power. His long stay there is a major part of 
                Sønderborg’s historical identity.

            <h2>The 1864 War and Dybbøl</h2>
            <p>
                The Second Schleswig War in 1864 is one of the most dramatic chapters in the 
                region’s history. The important Battle of Dybbøl took place only a few 
                kilometers from the city. Danish forces fought against the Prussian army, 
                and the defeat at Dybbøl had a huge impact on Denmark as a nation.
            </p>
            <p>
                After the war, Sønderborg and the whole region of Southern Jutland came under 
                German control. Life changed significantly; new institutions, schools, and 
                cultural influences appeared. The city became a meeting point of both Danish 
                and German traditions – a mix that is still visible today.

            <h2>Reunification in 1920</h2>
            <p>
                After World War I, a referendum was held in the region. The people of Sønderborg 
                and most of Southern Jutland voted to rejoin Denmark. On 10 July 1920, King Christian X 
                famously rode across the old border on a white horse, symbolizing the reunion.

                This event is one of the most celebrated moments in local history and continues to be 
                remembered every year with festivities and cultural events.

            <h2>Modern Sønderborg</h2>
            <p>
                Today, Sønderborg is a modern city that still respects its deep historical roots. 
                The waterfront has been renewed with new buildings, cafés, walking paths, and 
                cultural centers. The University of Southern Denmark has a campus in the city, 
                bringing international students and creating a lively atmosphere.
            </p>
            <p>
                Even with all the modern development, Sønderborg continues to preserve its old town, 
                the castle, and many historical buildings. This combination of old and new makes the 
                city a unique place for both visitors and residents.
